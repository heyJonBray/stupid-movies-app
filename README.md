# SMSP - Stupid Movies for Stupid People

I was feeling a little rusty on my frontend skills so I built a stupid movie app.

It uses The Movie Database API to show trending movies with search.

Custom trending movies algorithm.

### Built with:

- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)
- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- [Appwrite](https://appwrite.io/)
