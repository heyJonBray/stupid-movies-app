# SMSP - Stupid Movies for Stupid People

![SMSP Banner](./public/smsp-banner.png)

I was feeling a little rusty on my frontend skills so I built an app to freshen up. It uses The Movie Database API to show a list of currently trending movies along with some info, plus search.

Includes a custom trending movies algorithm that shows the top movies searched for.

### Built with:

- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)
- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- [Appwrite](https://appwrite.io/)
